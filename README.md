3, 2, 1... take off!

That's it, there you are. In less than a minute the rocket will take off and you will go down in history. All the newspapers were already headlining this morning "Tommy Pasqua, to infinity and beyond!".

The countdown begins: 10... 9... 8... . But big memory lapse, impossible to remember the button to take off! Fortunately, you remember one thing: among all the buttons, this is the only one that appears exactly twice .

From the list of buttons, write a program that returns the button that will launch the rocket.
Data
Entrance

Line 1 : an integer Nbetween 2 and 100, representing the number of buttons present in the cockpit.

Line 2 to N + 1 : on each line, a string of lowercase letters indicating the name of a button.
Exit

A line representing the character string appearing exactly 2 times in the list of buttons.

It is guaranteed that there is only one character string appearing twice.
Example

For the entrance :

6
rocket

Your program should return:

In effect : boostersis the only button present exactly twice.
